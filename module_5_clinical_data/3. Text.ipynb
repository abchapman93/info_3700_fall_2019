    "# Clinical Notes\n",
    "One of the most information-rich sources of clinical data are free-text clinical notes. These are written narratives which discuss many topics of a patient's care, such as diagnoses, history, treatment, complications, etc... Free-text notes offer very detailed accounts of a patient's clinical course, making them very useful for many purposes. However, free text is not inherently meaningful. Unlike ICD-9 or LOINC codes, clinical language does not offer standardized representations of clinical concepts, and unlike vitals and labs, the information found in text cannot be easily quantified and represented in a computable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of **natural language processing** offers methods for dealing with text and extracting **structured information** from an **unstructured data source**. Later in the semester we'll have a module specifically devoted to NLP. Today we'll look at a couple of text processing methods which give us some insight into the information contained in text.\n",
    "\n",

One such specialty is radiology. MIMIC-II contains a large number of **radiology reports** which contain a radiologist's interpretation of an image. For example, if a physician suspects a patient has pneumonia, they might order a CT scan. The radiologist will view the image from the scan and determine whether or not has a patient has pneumonia."

A method called **word embeddings** transforms words, which by default have no computational or semantic meaning, into vectors which contain some representation of what the words meaning. We won't go into the details here, but a quick summary is that we look at the **context** of word - the words nearby a target word - to estimate what it means.
